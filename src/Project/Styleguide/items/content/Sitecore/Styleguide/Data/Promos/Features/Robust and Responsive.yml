      Value: We know that our websites must work on desktop, mobile, tablet. They must work whether placed in a full width or narrow column and regardless of what else is on the page. You may want to have many instances of the same component on the same page. No problem, SXA components are robust and tested to work in as many scenarios as possible.<br /> They are also crafted carefully to work on any grid you might deploy on your site. Each of our components can be configured to take any number of columns the grid system support and the width can vary from breakpoint to breakpoint so you can be sure any Layout is achievable.
