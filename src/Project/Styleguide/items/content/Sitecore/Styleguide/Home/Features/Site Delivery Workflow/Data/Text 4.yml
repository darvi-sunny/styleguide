        <h2>At the same time your Front End developers....</h2>
        <p>There is a whole set of good news for your front-end developers. One of the best things is that they don't really need to change their tools and they don't need to know much about SXA or Sitecore. Because of how SXA operates, they don't even need to build HTML for the website. All they need to do is export the site using Creative Exchange and they get everything authors provided to them in a convenient Zip file. Once they unpack it on their machine, they can crack the files open in their favourite Sublime Texts or WebStorms and edit those as they would normally do. They can add any missing styling to the pages in places which are clearly highlighted in the markup, put additional files in Media Library and supplement themes with any styling changes your branding might require. Once that's done, they can Zip the site again and upload it back using Creative Exchange. SXA will take care of the rest - it will add the classes to the components, put the files where they belong in the Media Library and even make the additional classes re-usable to components on other pages so you can re-use those later with new content.</p>
        <p>Another good news is that CSS and JavaScript files in themes are logically divided into chunks that deal with one component at a time. Don't worry about performance though - after everything is done and deployed our Asset Optimizer will concatenate and zip the files so your work always performs at its best!</p>
